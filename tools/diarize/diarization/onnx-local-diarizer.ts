/**
 * OnnxLocalDiarizer — MVP1 real-diarization, ONNX-in-Node edition.
 *
 * Runs entirely in the Node process. No Python sidecar, no PyTorch. Uses:
 *
 *   - @huggingface/transformers' WeSpeakerFeatureExtractor for mel-fbank
 *     features (matches WeSpeaker's exact preprocessing config)
 *   - onnx-community/wespeaker-voxceleb-resnet34-LM (quantized, ~6.6 MB)
 *     for 256-dim speaker embeddings, executed via onnxruntime-node
 *   - OnlineSpeakerClustering (TypeScript, this package) for stable
 *     speaker IDs across the session
 *
 * Cost vs the previous Python sidecar:
 *   - Container image:  +~7 MB ONNX model (vs +~1.1 GB Python venv)
 *   - RAM per bot:      +~50-100 MiB (vs +~530 MiB Python+torch)
 *   - Cold start:       +~200 ms model load (vs +~8 s torch import)
 *   - CPU per region:   ~5-20 ms per embedding (vs ~35 ms PyTorch)
 *   - Process model:    single Node process (vs bot + Python child + IPC)
 *
 * The diarizer's `process(audio, ts)` accumulates audio in a per-speaker
 * inference window. On every silence→speech transition (detected via a
 * small local energy gate; we'll swap for bot's Silero VAD when this is
 * folded into the bot), it commits the just-ended utterance to the
 * embedding model and online-clustering. Frames inside an utterance get
 * the speaker label assigned to that utterance.
